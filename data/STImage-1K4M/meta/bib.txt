               population unique to cancer, which localized to a fibrovascular

               cells as a hub for intercellular communication. Multiple

               inherent to technologies. Current approaches cannot compare
               methods for an individual RNA molecule. Here, we present a novel
               platform-comparison method that combines barcoding strategies
               and long-read sequencing to sequence cDNA copies representing an
               individual RNA molecule on both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and
               Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We compare these long-read
               pairs in terms of sequence content and isoform patterns.
               Although individual read pairs show high similarity, we find
               differences in (1) aligned length, (2) transcription start site
               (TSS), (3) polyadenylation site (poly(A)-site) assignment, and
               (4) exon-intron structures. Overall, 25\% of read pairs disagree
               on either TSS, poly(A)-site, or splice site. Intron-chain
               disagreement typically arises from alignment errors of
               microexons and complicated splice sites. Our single-molecule
               technology comparison reveals that inconsistencies are often
               caused by sequencing error-induced inaccurate ONT alignments,
               especially to downstream GUNNGU donor motifs. However,
               annotation-disagreeing upstream shifts in NAGNAG acceptors in
               ONT are often confirmed by PacBio and are thus likely real. In
               both barcoded and nonbarcoded ONT reads, we find that intron
               number and proximity of GU/AGs better predict inconsistencies

               constituent cells is essential for understanding tissue dynamics
               in health and disease. We lack a comprehensive map of human
               distal airways, including the terminal and respiratory
               bronchioles (TRBs), which are implicated in respiratory
               diseases1-4. Here, using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell
               profiling of microdissected distal airways, we identify
               molecularly distinct TRB cell types that have not-to our
               knowledge-been previously characterized. These include
               airway-associated LGR5+ fibroblasts and TRB-specific alveolar
               type-0 (AT0) cells and TRB secretory cells (TRB-SCs). Connectome
               maps and organoid-based co-cultures reveal that LGR5+
               fibroblasts form a signalling hub in the airway niche. AT0 cells
               and TRB-SCs are conserved in primates and emerge dynamically
               during human lung development. Using a non-human primate model
               of lung injury, together with human organoids and tissue
               specimens, we show that alveolar type-2 cells in regenerating
               lungs transiently acquire an AT0 state from which they can
               differentiate into either alveolar type-1 cells or TRB-SCs. This
               differentiation programme is distinct from that identified in
               the mouse lung5-7. Our study also reveals mechanisms that drive
               the differentiation of the bipotent AT0 cell state into normal
               or pathological states. In sum, our findings revise human lung
               cell maps and lineage trajectories, and implicate an epithelial
               transitional state in primate lung regeneration and disease.",

               therapy, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
               technology to study the endothelial cells of the human diabetic
               skin. Single-cell suspensions were generated from the human skin

               Single-cell 3' Kit v3.1. Using appropriate quality control

               scRNA-seq studies identified that although VEGF signaling was
               not significantly altered in diabetic versus nondiabetic skin,
               phospholipase C$\gamma$2 (PLC$\gamma$2) was downregulated. The
               significance of PLC$\gamma$2 in VEGF-mediated increase in
               endothelial cell metabolism and function was assessed in
               cultured human microvascular endothelial cells. In these cells,
               VEGF enhanced mitochondrial function, as indicated by elevation
               in oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate.
               The VEGF-dependent increase in cell metabolism was blunted in
               response to PLC$\gamma$2 inhibition. Follow-up rescue studies
               therefore focused on understanding the significance of VEGF
               therapy in presence or absence of endothelial PLC$\gamma$2 in
               type 1 (streptozotocin-injected) and type 2 (db/db) diabetic

               associated with tissue edema, a commonly noted complication
               associated with proangiogenic gene therapies. Taken together,
               our study demonstrates that TNT-mediated delivery of endothelial

               our understanding of kidney biology and disease, but the loss of
               spatial information in these datasets hinders our interpretation
               of intercellular communication networks and regional gene

               platforms make it possible to measure the topography of gene
               expression at genome depth. METHODS: We optimized and validated
               a female bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury model. Using the
               10$\times$ Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression solution, we
               generated spatial maps of gene expression across the injury and
               repair time course, and applied two open-source computational
               tools, Giotto and SPOTlight, to increase resolution and measure
               cell-cell interaction dynamics. RESULTS: An ischemia time of 34
               minutes in a female murine model resulted in comparable injury
               to 22 minutes for males. We report a total of 16,856 unique
               genes mapped across our injury and repair time course. Giotto, a
               computational toolbox for spatial data analysis, enabled
               increased resolution mapping of genes and cell types. Using a
               seeded nonnegative matrix regression (SPOTlight) to deconvolute
               the dynamic landscape of cell-cell interactions, we found that
               injured proximal tubule cells were characterized by increasing
               macrophage and lymphocyte interactions even 6 weeks after
               injury, potentially reflecting the AKI to CKD transition.

               combining histological spatial information with transcriptomics
               profiles directly from tissue sections. The use of spatial
               information has made it possible to discover new modes of gene
               expression regulations. However, in the ST experiment, the
               nucleus size of cells may exceed the thickness of a tissue
               slice. This may, in turn, negatively affect comprehensive
               capturing the transcriptomics profile in a single slice,
               especially for tissues having large differences in the size of
               nuclei. METHODS: Here, we defined the effect of Consecutive
               Slices Data Integration (CSDI) on unveiling accurate spot
               clustering and deconvolution of spatial transcriptomic spots in
               human postmortem brains. By considering the histological
               information as reference, we assessed the improvement of
               unsupervised clustering and single nuclei RNA-seq and ST data
               integration before and after CSDI. RESULTS: Apart from the
               escalated number of defined clusters representing neuronal
               layers, the pattern of clusters in consecutive sections was
               concordant only after CSDI. Besides, the assigned cell labels to
               spots matches the histological pattern of tissue sections after
               CSDI. CONCLUSION: CSDI can be applied to investigate consecutive
               sections studied with ST in the human cerebral cortex, avoiding
               misinterpretation of spot clustering and annotation, increasing
               accuracy of cell recognition as well as improvement in
               uncovering the layers of grey matter in the human brain.",

               gastric cancer from GAstric Neoplasia (GAN) mice, which express
               Wnt1 and the enzymes COX2 and microsomal prostaglandin E

               organoids and KRASG12V -expressing GAN-p53KO (GAN-KP) organoids
               were generated by genetic manipulation of GAN mouse-derived
               tumor (GAN wild-type [WT]) organoids. In contrast with GAN-WT
               and GAN-p53KO organoids, which manifested Wnt addiction, GAN-KP
               organoids showed a Wnt-independent phenotype and the ability to
               proliferate without formation of a Wnt-regulated
               three-dimensional epithelial architecture. After transplantation
               in syngeneic mouse stomach, GAN-p53KO cells formed only small
               tumors, whereas GAN-KP cells gave rise to invasive tumors
               associated with the development of hypoxia as well as to liver
               metastasis. Spatial transcriptomics analysis suggested that
               hypoxia signaling contributes to the metastatic progression of
               GAN-KP tumors. In particular, such analysis identified a cluster
               of stromal cells located at the tumor invasive front that
               expressed genes related to hypoxia signaling, angiogenesis, and
               cell migration. These cells were also positive for
               phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),
               suggesting that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
               signaling promotes development of both tumor and
               microenvironment. The MEK (MAPK kinase) inhibitor trametinib
               suppressed the development of GAN-KP gastric tumors, formation
               of a hypoxic microenvironment, tumor angiogenesis, and liver
               metastasis. Our findings therefore establish a rationale for
               application of trametinib to suppress metastatic progression of

               male grass puffers every week for 2 months. RNA sequencing
               (RNA-seq) analysis identified 125 semilunar genes, including
               genes crucial for reproduction (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing
               hormone 1 [gnrh1], luteinizing hormone $\beta$ subunit [lhb])

               pathogenetic pathway of two diverse diseases, i.e.
               atherosclerosis and dementia. C1q is the initiating and
               controlling protein of the classical complement cascade (CCC),
               which occupies a key role in multiple acute and chronic
               inflammatory tissue responses. C1q is largely produced by
               myeloid cells including Kupffer cells (KCs) and subsequently
               secreted into the circulation as an inactive preprotein. Its
               binding partner, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is produced by KCs and
               hepatocytes and it is also secreted into the circulation, where
               it regulates essential steps of lipid transport. In addition to
               its major source, ApoE can be produced by non-liver cells
               including immune cells and multiple other cells depending on
               local tissue contexts. To initiate the CCC cascade, C1q must be
               activated by molecules as varied as oxidized lipids, amyloid
               fibrils, and immune complexes. However, ApoE is mute towards
               inactive C1q but binds at high-affinity to its activated form.
               Specifically, our studies revealed that ApoE is a CCC-specific
               checkpoint inhibitor via the formation of the C1q-ApoE complex.
               We proposed that it may arise in multiple if not all
               CCC-associated diseases and that its presence indicates ongoing
               CCC activity. Here, we turned to the liver to examine C1q-ApoE
               complexes in human B- and C-viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic
               fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, we used
               multidrug-resistance-2 gene-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice as a model
               for inflammatory liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma
               (HCC) pathogenesis. In normal murine and human livers, KCs were
               the major C1q-producing cell type while hepatocytes were the
               primary ApoE-forming cell type though the C1q-ApoE complex was
               rare or nonexistent. However, significant numbers of C1q-ApoE
               complexes formed in both Mdr2-KO, human viral hepatitis, and
               NAFLD around portal triads where immune cells had infiltrated
               the liver. Additionally, high numbers of C1q-ApoE complexes
               emerged in human livers in areas of extracellular lipid droplets
               across the entire liver parenchyma in NAFLD-affected patients.

              (RA). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this lymphatic
              dysfunction remain poorly understood. Herein, we utilized
              multi-omic spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to evaluate
              altered cellular composition (including lymphatic endothelial
              cells, macrophages, B-cells, and T-cells) in the joint-draining

              cell-cell interactions during RA development using the tumor
              necrosis factor transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse model. Methods:
              Popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs) from wild-type (n=10) and TNF-Tg
              male mice with ``Early'' (5 to 6-months of age; n=6) and
              ``Advanced'' (>8-months of age; n=12) arthritis were harvested
              and processed for spatial transcriptomics. Single-cell RNA
              sequencing (scRNAseq) was performed in PLNs from the TNF-Tg
              cohorts (n=6 PLNs pooled/cohort). PLN histopathology and ELISPOT
              along with ankle histology and micro-CT were evaluated.
              Histopathology of human lymph nodes and synovia was performed for
              clinical correlation. Results: Advanced PLN sinuses exhibited an
              increased Ighg2b/Ighm expression ratio (Early 0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 vs
              Advanced 1.4 $\pm$ 0.5 counts/counts; p<0.001) that significantly
              correlated with reduced talus bone volumes in the afferent ankle
              (R2 = 0.54, p<0.001). Integration of single-cell and spatial
              transcriptomics revealed the increased IgG2b+ plasma cells
              localized in MARCO+ peri-follicular medullary sinuses. A
              concomitant decreased Fth1 expression (Early 2.5 $\pm$ 0.74 vs
              Advanced 1.0 $\pm$ 0.50 counts, p<0.001) within Advanced PLN
              sinuses was associated with accumulation of iron-laden Prussian
              blue positive macrophages in lymph nodes and synovium of Advanced
              TNF-Tg mice, and further validated in RA clinical samples.
              T-cells were increased 8-fold in Advanced PLNs, and bioinformatic
              pathway assessment identified the interaction between ALCAM+
              macrophages and CD6+ T-cells as a plausible co-stimulatory
              mechanism to promote IgG2b class-switching. Discussion:
              Collectively, these data support a model of flare in chronic
              TNF-induced arthritis in which loss of lymphatic flow through
              affected joint-draining lymph nodes facilitates the interaction
              between effluxing macrophages and T-cells via ALCAM-CD6
              co-stimulation, initiating IgG2b class-switching and plasma cell
              differentiation of the expanded Bin population. Future work is

               the cellular and molecular crosstalk in AD skin has not been
               fully understood. METHODS: Skin tissues examined for spatial
               gene expression were derived from the upper arm of 6 healthy
               control (HC) donors and 7 AD patients (lesion and nonlesion). We
               performed spatial transcriptomics sequencing to characterize the
               cellular infiltrate in lesional skin. For single-cell analysis,
               we analyzed the single-cell data from suction blister material
               from AD lesions and HC skin at the antecubital fossa skin (4 ADs
               and 5 HCs) and full-thickness skin biopsies (4 ADs and 2 HCs).
               The multiple proximity extension assays were performed in the
               serum samples from 36 AD patients and 28 HCs. RESULTS: The
               single-cell analysis identified unique clusters of fibroblasts,
               dendritic cells, and macrophages in the lesional AD skin.
               Spatial transcriptomics analysis showed the upregulation of
               COL6A5, COL4A1, TNC, and CCL19 in COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts
               in the leukocyte-infiltrated areas in AD skin. CCR7-expressing
               dendritic cells (DCs) showed a similar distribution in the
               lesions. Additionally, M2 macrophages expressed CCL13 and CCL18
               in this area. Ligand-receptor interaction analysis of the
               spatial transcriptome identified neighboring infiltration and
               interaction between activated COL18A1-expressing fibroblasts,
               CCL13- and CCL18-expressing M2 macrophages, CCR7- and

               serum levels of TNC and CCL18 were significantly elevated in AD,
               and correlated with clinical disease severity. CONCLUSION: In
               this study, we show the unknown cellular crosstalk in
               leukocyte-infiltrated area in lesional skin. Our findings

               transcriptomic signature across subregions of the hippocampus
               has remained challenging. Here, we utilized unbiased spatial

               changes across subregions of the dorsal hippocampus of male mice

               hippocampus exhibits distinct yet overlapping transcriptomic
               signatures. The CA1 region exhibited increased expression of
               genes related to transcriptional regulation, while the DG showed
               upregulation of genes associated with protein folding.
               Importantly, our approach enabled us to define the
               transcriptomic signature of learning within two less-defined
               hippocampal subregions, CA1 stratum radiatum, and oriens. We

               assess the consequences of inducible Inpp5d knockdown in
               microglia of APPKM670/671NL /PSEN1$\Delta$exon9 (PSAPP) mice, we

               microglia to plaques. Spatial transcriptomics highlighted an

              cells remain unclear. Here, we used spatial transcriptomics to
              elucidate therapeutic mechanisms of human neural stem cells
              (hNSCs) in an animal model of AD. Methods: hNSCs were
              transplanted into the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus using the
              5XFAD mouse model. Spatial memory was assessed by Morris water
              maze. Amyloid plaque burden was quantified. Spatial
              transcriptomics was performed and differentially expressed genes
              (DEGs) identified both globally and within the hippocampus.
              Subsequent pathway enrichment and ligand-receptor network
              analysis was performed. Results: hNSC transplantation restored
              learning curves of 5XFAD mice. However, there were no changes in
              amyloid plaque burden. Spatial transcriptomics showed 1,061 DEGs

              was also restored. Discussion: hNSCs normalized many dysregulated

              plaque levels. Rather, hNSCs appear to exert beneficial effects

               Specific subtypes, such as claudin-low and metaplastic breast
               carcinoma (MpBC), have been associated with high nongenetic
               plasticity, which can facilitate resistance. The similarities

               identify high-plasticity tumors to better anticipate resistance
               are lacking. Here, we analyzed 11 triple-negative breast tumors,
               including 3 claudin-low and 4 MpBC, via high-resolution spatial
               transcriptomics. We combined pathological annotations and
               deconvolution approaches to precisely identify tumor spots, on

               aimed to elucidate potential approaches for stromal
               reprogramming and improved cancer immunotherapy.
               Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC) and D expression were
               significantly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with
               gastric cancer, and PDGF receptor beta (PDGFR$\beta$) was
               predominantly expressed in diffuse-type gastric cancer stroma.
               CAFs stimulated with PDGFs exhibited markedly increased
               expression of CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL8, which are involved
               in polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC)

               increased PMN-MDSC accumulation and decreased lymphocyte
               infiltration, as well as resistance to anti-PD-1. Single-cell

              tumours, including breast cancers. We applied spatial
              transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-sequencing on patient-derived
              xenografts (PDXs) to profile spatially resolved cell populations
              within oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+ ) breast cancer and to
              elucidate their importance in oestrogen-dependent tumour growth.
              METHODS: Two PDXs of 'ER-high' breast cancers with opposite
              oestrogen-mediated growth responses were investigated:
              oestrogen-suppressed GS3 (80-100\% ER) and oestrogen-dependent
              SC31 (40-90\% ER) models. The observation was validated via
              single-cell analyses on an 'ER-low' PDX, GS1 (5\% ER). The
              results from our spatial and single-cell analyses were further
              supported by a public ER+ breast cancer single-cell dataset and
              protein-based dual immunohistochemistry (IHC) of SC31 examining
              important luminal cancer markers (i.e., ER, progesterone receptor
              and Ki67). The translational implication of our findings was
              assessed by clinical outcome analyses on publicly available
              cohorts. RESULTS: Our space-gene-function study revealed four
              spatially distinct compartments within ER+ breast cancers. These
              compartments showed functional diversity (oestrogen-responsive,
              proliferative, hypoxia-induced and inflammation-related). The
              'proliferative' population, rather than the
              'oestrogen-responsive' compartment, was crucial for
              oestrogen-dependent tumour growth, leading to the acquisition of
              luminal B-like features. The cells expressing typical
              oestrogen-responsive genes like PGR were not directly linked to
              oestrogen-dependent proliferation. Dual IHC analyses demonstrated
              the distinct contribution of the Ki67+ proliferative cells toward
              oestrogen-mediated growth and their response to a CDK4/6
              inhibitor. The gene signatures derived from the proliferative,
              hypoxia-induced and inflammation-related compartments were
              significantly correlated with worse clinical outcomes, while
              patients with the oestrogen-responsive signature showed better
              prognoses, suggesting that this compartment would not be directly
              associated with oestrogen-dependent tumour progression.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified the gene signature in our
              'proliferative' compartment as an important determinant of
              luminal cancer subtypes. This 'proliferative' cell population is
              a causative feature of luminal B breast cancer, contributing
              toward its aggressive behaviours.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Rhynchophylline (RHY) is an alkaloid component of
              Uncaria, which are plants extensively used in traditional Asian
              medicines. Uncaria treatments increase sleep time and quality in
              humans, and RHY induces sleep in rats. However, like many
              traditional natural treatments, the mechanisms of action of RHY
              and Uncaria remain evasive. Moreover, it is unknown whether RHY
              modifies key brain oscillations during sleep. We thus aimed at
              defining the effects of RHY on sleep architecture and
              oscillations throughout a 24-h cycle, as well as identifying the
              underlying molecular mechanisms. Mice received systemic RHY
              injections at two times of the day (beginning and end of the
              light period), and vigilance states were studied by
              electrocorticographic recordings. RESULTS: RHY enhanced slow wave
              sleep (SWS) after both injections, suppressed paradoxical sleep
              (PS) in the light but enhanced PS in the dark period.
              Furthermore, RHY modified brain oscillations during both
              wakefulness and SWS (including delta activity dynamics) in a
              time-dependent manner. Interestingly, most effects were larger in
              females. A brain spatial transcriptomic analysis showed that RHY
              modifies the expression of genes linked to cell movement,
              apoptosis/necrosis, and transcription/translation in a brain
              region-independent manner, and changes those linked to sleep
              regulation (e.g., Hcrt, Pmch) in a brain region-specific manner
              (e.g., in the hypothalamus). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide
              support to the sleep-inducing effect of RHY, expose the relevance
              to shape wake/sleep oscillations, and highlight its effects on
              the transcriptome with a high spatial resolution. The exposed
              molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of a natural compound
              should benefit sleep- and brain-related medicine.",

               leading to dysregulated repair and cytotoxic responses.
               Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) have key roles in PDAC2,
               but their diversity has prevented therapeutic exploitation. Here
               we combined single-cell and spatial genomics with functional
               experiments to unravel macrophage functions in pancreatic
               cancer. We uncovered an inflammatory loop between tumour cells
               and interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$)-expressing TAMs, a subset
               of macrophages elicited by a local synergy between prostaglandin
               E2 (PGE2) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Physical proximity
               with IL-1$\beta$+ TAMs was associated with inflammatory
               reprogramming and acquisition of pathogenic properties by a
               subset of PDAC cells. This occurrence was an early event in
               pancreatic tumorigenesis and led to persistent transcriptional
               changes associated with disease progression and poor outcomes
               for patients. Blocking PGE2 or IL-1$\beta$ activity elicited TAM
               reprogramming and antagonized tumour cell-intrinsic and
               -extrinsic inflammation, leading to PDAC control in vivo.

              a murine model. We administered human recombinant IGF-1 or saline
              (control) in atherosclerotic FH pigs for 6 months. IGF-1
              decreased relative coronary atheroma in vivo (intravascular
              ultrasound) and reduced lesion cross-sectional area (postmortem

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterised by
              extensive tissue fibrosis maintained by
              mechanotranductive/proadhesive signalling. Drugs targeting this
              pathway are therefore of likely therapeutic benefit. The
              mechanosensitive transcriptional co-activator, yes activated
              protein-1 (YAP1), is activated in SSc fibroblasts. The terpenoid
              celastrol is a YAP1 inhibitor; however, if celastrol can
              alleviate SSc fibrosis is unknown. Moreover, the cell niches
              required for skin fibrosis are unknown. METHODS: Human dermal
              fibroblasts from healthy individuals and patients with diffuse
              cutaneous SSc were treated with or without transforming growth
              factor $\beta$1 (TGF$\beta$1), with or without celastrol. Mice
              were subjected to the bleomycin-induced model of skin SSc, in the
              presence or absence of celastrol. Fibrosis was assessed using RNA
              Sequencing, real-time PCR, spatial transcriptomic analyses,
              Western blot, ELISA and histological analyses. RESULTS: In dermal
              fibroblasts, celastrol impaired the ability of TGF$\beta$1 to
              induce an SSc-like pattern of gene expression, including that of
              cellular communication network factor 2, collagen I and
              TGF$\beta$1. Celastrol alleviated the persistent fibrotic
              phenotype of dermal fibroblasts cultured from lesions of SSc
              patients. In the bleomycin-induced model of skin SSc, increased
              expression of genes associated with reticular fibroblast and
              hippo/YAP clusters was observed; conversely, celastrol inhibited
              these bleomycin-induced changes and blocked nuclear localisation
              of YAP. CONCLUSIONS: Our data clarify niches within the skin
              activated in fibrosis and suggest that compounds, such as
              celastrol, that antagonise the YAP pathway may be potential
              treatments for SSc skin fibrosis.",

              can inform novel targeted therapies. Of the 3499 differentially

              IPMNs is unknown, although identifying drivers of this indolent
              phenotype might enable opportunities for intercepting progression

              immune-mediated cholestatic liver disease for which there is an
              unmet need to understand the cellular composition of the affected
              liver and how it underlies disease pathogenesis. We aimed to
              generate a comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver using multi-omic
              modalities and protein-based functional validation. METHODS: We
              employed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (47,156
              cells and 23,000 nuclei) and spatial transcriptomics (one sample
              by 10x Visium and five samples with Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to
              profile the cellular ecosystem in 10 PSC livers. Transcriptomic
              profiles were compared to 24 neurologically deceased donor livers
              (107,542 cells) and spatial transcriptomics controls, as well as
              18,240 cells and 20,202 nuclei from three PBC livers. Flow
              cytometry was performed to validate PSC-specific differences in
              immune cell phenotype and function. RESULTS: PSC explants with
              parenchymal cirrhosis and prominent periductal fibrosis contained
              a population of cholangiocyte-like hepatocytes that were
              surrounded by diverse immune cell populations. PSC-associated
              biliary, mesenchymal, and endothelial populations expressed
              chemokine and cytokine transcripts involved in immune cell
              recruitment. Additionally, expanded CD4+ T cells and recruited
              myeloid populations in the PSC liver expressed the corresponding
              receptors to these chemokines and cytokines, suggesting potential
              recruitment. Tissue-resident macrophages, by contrast, were
              reduced in number and exhibited a dysfunctional and downregulated
              inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide and
              interferon-$\gamma$ stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: We present a
              comprehensive atlas of the PSC liver and demonstrate an
              exhaustion-like phenotype of myeloid cells and markers of chronic
              cytokine expression in late-stage PSC lesions. This atlas expands
              our understanding of the cellular complexity of PSC and has
              potential to guide the development of novel treatments. IMPACT
              AND IMPLICATIONS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare
              liver disease characterized by chronic inflammation and
              irreparable damage to the bile ducts, which eventually results in
              liver failure. Due to a limited understanding of the underlying
              pathogenesis of disease, treatment options are limited. To
              address this, we sequenced healthy and diseased livers to compare
              the activity, interactions, and localization of immune and
              non-immune cells. This revealed that hepatocytes lining PSC scar
              regions co-express cholangiocyte markers, whereas immune cells
              infiltrate the scar lesions. Of these cells, macrophages, which
              typically contribute to tissue repair, were enriched in
              immunoregulatory genes and demonstrated a lack of responsiveness
              to stimulation. These cells may be involved in maintaining
              hepatic inflammation and could be a target for novel therapies.",

               an X-linked gene or lineage tracing, respectively, have
               suggested that clones of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) exist in
               human atherosclerotic lesions but are limited by either spatial
               resolution or translatability of the model. METHODS: Phenotypic
               clonality can be detected by X-chromosome inactivation patterns.
               We investigated whether clones of SMCs exist in unstable human
               atheroma using RNA in situ hybridization (BaseScope) to identify
               a naturally occurring 24-nucleotide deletion in the 3'UTR of the
               X-linked BGN (biglycan) gene, a proteoglycan highly expressed by
               SMCs. BGN-specific BaseScope probes were designed to target the
               wild-type or deletion mRNA. Three different coronary artery
               plaque types (erosion, rupture, and adaptive intimal thickening)
               were selected from heterozygous females for the deletion BGN.
               Hybridization of target RNA-specific probes was used to
               visualize the spatial distribution of mutants. A clonality index
               was calculated from the percentage of each probe in each region
               of interest. Spatial transcriptomics were used to identify
               differentially expressed transcripts within clonal and nonclonal
               regions. RESULTS: Less than one-half of regions of interest in
               the intimal plaque were considered clonal with the mean percent
               regions of interest with clonality higher in the intimal plaque
               than in the media. This was consistent for all plaque types. The
               relationship of the dominant clone in the intimal plaque and
               media showed significant concordance. In comparison with the
               nonclonal lesions, the regions with SMC clonality had lower
               expression of genes encoding cell growth suppressors such as
               CD74, SERF-2 (small EDRK-rich factor 2), CTSB (cathepsin B), and
               HLA-DPA1 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP alpha
               1), among others. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach to examine
               clonality suggests atherosclerosis is primarily a disease of
               polyclonally and to a lesser extent clonally expanded SMCs and

               chromosomes of infected hepatocytes, contributing to the
               production of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and to
               hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, we aimed to explore whether
               transcriptionally active HBV integration events spread
               throughout the liver tissue in different phases of chronic HBV
               infection, especially in patients with HBsAg loss. DESIGN: We
               constructed high-resolution spatial transcriptomes of liver
               biopsies containing 13 059 tissue spots from 18 patients with
               chronic HBV infection to analyse the occurrence and relative
               distribution of transcriptionally active viral integration
               events. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the
               expression of HBsAg and HBV core antigen. Intrahepatic
               covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels were quantified
               by real-time qPCR. RESULTS: Spatial transcriptome sequencing
               identified the presence of 13 154 virus-host chimeric reads in
               7.86\% (1026 of 13 059) of liver tissue spots in all patients,
               including three patients with HBsAg loss. These HBV integration
               sites were randomly distributed on chromosomes and can localise
               in host genes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, such as ALB, CLU
               and APOB. Patients who were receiving or had received antiviral
               treatment had a significantly lower percentage of viral
               integration-containing spots and significantly fewer chimeric
               reads than treatment-na{\"\i}ve patients. Intrahepatic cccDNA
               levels correlated well with viral integration events.
               CONCLUSION: Transcriptionally active HBV integration occurred in
               chronically HBV-infected patients at different phases, including
               in patients with HBsAg loss. Antiviral treatment was associated
               with a decreased number and extent of transcriptionally active
               viral integrations, implying that early treatment intervention
               may further reduce the number of viral integration events.",

              Conditional deletion of the Ngf gene in either myeloid or

              repair. Similarly, inhibition of the NGF receptor tropomyosin

              injury. Sural nerve transection blocked the postinjury increase

               Here, stemming from a single-cell analysis of mononuclear

               tumor-associated MÏ (TAM), expressing glycoprotein nonmetastatic
               melanoma protein B (GPNMB). SERPINB2+ MoMÏ had an early

  abstract  = "Breast cancers are complex cellular ecosystems where heterotypic
               interactions play central roles in disease progression and
               response to therapy. However, our knowledge of their cellular
               composition and organization is limited. Here we present a
               single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics analysis of
               human breast cancers. We developed a single-cell method of
               intrinsic subtype classification (SCSubtype) to reveal recurrent
               neoplastic cell heterogeneity. Immunophenotyping using cellular
               indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq)
               provides high-resolution immune profiles, including new
               PD-L1/PD-L2+ macrophage populations associated with clinical
               outcome. Mesenchymal cells displayed diverse functions and
               cell-surface protein expression through differentiation within
               three major lineages. Stromal-immune niches were spatially
               organized in tumors, offering insights into antitumor immune
               regulation. Using single-cell signatures, we deconvoluted large
               breast cancer cohorts to stratify them into nine clusters,
               termed 'ecotypes', with unique cellular compositions and
               clinical outcomes. This study provides a comprehensive

  abstract  = "Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide1.
               Although advances have been made in acute treatment, an
               incomplete understanding of remodelling processes has limited
               the effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality2.
               Here we generate an integrative high-resolution map of human
               cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction using
               single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and spatial
               transcriptomic profiling of multiple physiological zones at
               distinct time points in myocardium from patients with myocardial
               infarction and controls. Multi-modal data integration enabled us
               to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased
               resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac
               transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of
               distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling. We
               identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of
               major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context,
               evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data
               elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue
               organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid
               continuum following ischaemic injury. In sum, our study provides
               an integrative molecular map of human myocardial infarction,
               represents an essential reference for the field and paves the
               way for advanced mechanistic and therapeutic studies of cardiac

               fundamental to improving early diagnosis of cancer1. Here we use
               a systematic approach to study spatial genome integrity in situ
               and describe previously unidentified clonal relationships. We
               used spatially resolved transcriptomics2 to infer spatial copy
               number variations in >120,000 regions across multiple organs, in
               benign and malignant tissues. We demonstrate that genome-wide
               copy number variation reveals distinct clonal patterns within
               tumours and in nearby benign tissue using an organ-wide approach
               focused on the prostate. Our results suggest a model for how
               genomic instability arises in histologically benign tissue that
               may represent early events in cancer evolution. We highlight the
               power of capturing the molecular and spatial continuums in a
               tissue context and challenge the rationale for treatment
               paradigms, including focal therapy.",
